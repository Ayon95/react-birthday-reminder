## Birthday Reminder

This application allows users to create an account, and save birthdays of people that they want to remember. It tells a user if there is any birthday today, and also if there are any upcoming birthdays.

This application has CRUD functionality and user authentication. Users have to log in to be able to add, delete, or edit a birthday. I used React for the frontend of this application. For backend services like database, and authentication, I used Firebase.
